MetuMail is an unofficial, third-party email client for Middle East Technical University (METU) email accounts. The App acts solely as an intermediary that establishes communication between METU's mail servers and your device to enable you to view and interact with your emails. MetuMail is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially associated with METU, and has no ownership, control, or authority over your METU email account or its contents.
