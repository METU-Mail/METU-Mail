## 2. Description of Service

MetuMail is an unofficial, third-party mobile email client designed for Middle East Technical University (METU) email account holders. The App acts as an intermediary that establishes communication between METU's mail servers and your device, enabling you to view, compose, search, and manage your emails.

**MetuMail is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially associated with Middle East Technical University (METU).** MetuMail does not have ownership, control, or authority over your METU email account or its contents. Your emails reside solely on METU's servers, and the management of your METU email account (including creation and deletion) is solely under the authority of METU.

## 3. Eligibility

To use the App, you must:

- Hold a valid METU email account
- Be at least 13 years of age

## 4. User Accounts and Authentication

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your METU credentials used within the App.
- You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
- You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

- Interfere with or disrupt the App's services or servers

## 6. Intellectual Property

- The App, including its design, code, and branding, is the property of the developer and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
- METU's name, logo, and trademarks belong to Middle East Technical University. Their appearance in the App does not imply endorsement.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The App relies on the following third-party services:

- **METU Mail Servers** for email delivery and retrieval
- **Supabase** for user metadata and preferences storage
- **Expo Push Notification Service** for push notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for Android notification delivery

Each third-party service is subject to its own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices or availability of these services.

## 8. Availability and Updates

- We strive to keep the App available and functional, but do not guarantee uninterrupted access.
- The App may be updated periodically to improve functionality, fix bugs, or address security issues.
- We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the App at any time without prior notice.
- Service availability depends on METU's mail server uptime, which is outside our control.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.

## 12. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting the updated Terms within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 13. Data Deletion

- Local data on your device will be immediately cleared upon data deletion.
- Alternatively, you may request data deletion by contacting us at the email address provided below.
- **Important:** Deleting your MetuMail data does **not** delete your METU email account. Your METU email account and its contents are managed solely by METU. MetuMail has no authority to create, modify, or delete METU email accounts.
